Simple chess AI written in python
 - Works with any type of chess board (see runner.py to play a game of Hexapawn with it)
 - AI uses minimax with simple evaluation function


TO DO:
  - find out how to make the current implementation faster
  - make an AI for actual chess (current implementation does not have en-passant or castling)
    - custom evaluation function - neural network?
    - opening book
    - generate endgame tablebases
