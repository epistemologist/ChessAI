Simple chess AI written in python (version 1)
 - Works with any type of chess board (see runner.py to play a game of Hexapawn with it)
 - AI uses minimax with simple evaluation function
Chess AI version 2
 - uses python-chess module for faster implementation for an 8x8 board

TO DO:
  - find out how to make the current implementation (version 1) faster
  - make an AI for actual chess (current implementation does not have en-passant or castling)
    - custom evaluation function - neural network?
    - opening book
    - generate endgame tablebases
